			"While many who reach such heights of power stop at nothing\n" +
			"to achieve immortality, the idea of becoming a lich is\n" +
			"abhorrent to most creatures. The process involves the\n" +
			"extraction of the spellcaster\'s life-force and its imprisonment\n" +
			"in a specially prepared phylactery-the spellcaster gives up\n" +
			"life, but in trapping life he also traps his death, and as long as\n" +
			"his phylactery remains intact he can continue on in his\n" +
			"research and work without fear of the passage of time.\n" +
			"The quest to become a lich is a lengthy one. While\n" +

			"spellcaster\'s soul is a critical component, a prospective lich\n" +
			"must also learn the secrets of transferring his soul into the\n" +

			"into undeath, neither of which are simple tasks. Further\n" +
			"complicating the ritual is the fact that no two bodies or souls\n" +
			"are exactly alike-a ritual that works for one spellcaster\n" +
			"might simply kill another or drive him insane. The exact\n" +
			"methods for each spellcaster\'s transformation are left to the\n" +
			"GM\'s discretion, but should involve expenditures of\n" +
			"hundreds of thousands of gold pieces, numerous deadly\n" +
			"adventures, and a large number of difficult skill checks over\n" +
			"the course of months, years, or decades.\n" +
			"The Lich\'s Phylactery\n" +
			"An integral part of becoming a lich is the creation of the\n" +
			"phylactery in which the character stores his soul. The only\n" +
			"way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery.\n" +
			"Unless its phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich can\n" +

			"Each lich must create its own phylactery by using the Craft\n" +
			"Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast spells\n" +
			"and have a caster level of 11th or higher. The phylactery\n" +
			"costs 120000 gp to create and has a caster level equal to that\n" +
			"of its creator at the time of creation.\n" +
			"The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box\n" +

			"hardness 20, and a break DC of 40.\n" +
